1) make a new directory inside  NRAO/transmission_line_models directory and name it the name of the line


2) make a class that inherits from abstract_super_conducting_line_model.py

3) implement the methods from abstract_super_conducting_line_model

4) implement a new model inputs obj in model_inputs
    -   This will take in a map that will eventually come from the inputs of the GUI
    -   Example of inputs map and GUI inputs:


5) next in floquet_line_model/floquet_line_builder.py from the other example lines instantiate the floquet line class
